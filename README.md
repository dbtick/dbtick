- 👋 Hi, I’m @dbtick
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code to solve puzzles efficiently (2d and 3d jigsaws) - not just using brute force.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and learning and learning and learning... what a journey :-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything sotfware/hardware crossover, data networking through to abstract code forms.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you know already!
